            <h3>How does FakenewsResearch work?</h3>
            <p class="bar-text regular-text">FakenewsResearch is an <span class="imp">automated collection of scientific papers</span>, based on the data retrieved from
              <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/academic-knowledge/" target ="_blank">the Microsoft Academic Knowledge</a> APIs.
              We downloaded any paper that contains one of these keywords in the title:
            </p>

              <ul>
                <li>fake news</li>
                <li>misinformation</li>
                <li>disinformation</li>
                <li>hoax</li>
                <li>false news</li>
                <li>social bot</li>
                <li>fact check%</li>
                <li>fact-check%</li>
                <li>infodemic</li>
                <li>information disorder</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
              We are aware that we may have downloaded many unrelevant papers, and perhaps missed many relevant contributions, but as long as we can provide a useful service,
              we don't think a few misplaced papers are a too big issue. <br> <br>
              Each paper comes with a list of papers it references. We download them all, as they may be relevant papers without one of the keywords in the title. We flag
              all the papers containing one of the keyword in the title or in the abstract as relevant, and we flag the remaining papers as "referenced papers". When you
              query about a word, you search only the relevant papers, unless you check the box <span class="imp">search also in referenced papers</span>.
              We then built a citation network, and we computed several centrality measures like the betweenness centrality, the pagerank, and the
              hubs and authorities centrality. We believe these measure to give different ideas of influence of a paper: some papers receive many authorable citations,
              and we can consider them as fundamental inspirations for important works; some other papers cite many authorable works, hence they are valuable (also) for
              their rich refecences section; some papers are in between od two groups of papers, like bridges in the middle of two disciplines. We highlighted the hidden gems
               in this dataset, among the query results.<br> <br>
              Last, we computed a text similarity score for each possible pair of papers, using <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3044805.3045025" target="_blank">Doc2Vec<a>. This allowed us to save, for each paper, the 10 most similar to check.
              We believe that even a basic recommendation system like this one may help researchers to find interesting contributions to read, moving from one paper to another by following suggestions. <br>
              We update the dataset and repeat all the analyses twice per month, to keep up with the enormous scientific production of these years.<br><br>

            <h3>Why I do see that many mistakes?</h3>
            <p class="bar-text regular-text">
              You may experience some bug here and there. Maybe some papers have no abstract, or the references list doesn't match with the one you can find elsewhere, or
              the author list may be partial, with wrong affiliations. We are not responsible for the data itself, but we also believe that people at Microsoft are doing a terrific job, and we should just thank them.
              All this application is possible because of them sharing their hard work with the community, and we are extremely grateful. If you see something wrong, please
              contact us, and we will try to fix it based on your alerts. <br> <br>
              The same applies, of course, to our analyses and algorithms. FakenewsResearch is updated <span class="imp">automatically</span>! It means we don't do any supervision,
              we only check if everything works after the last update. If something gets messed up, please let us know. <br> <br>
